# iOS StarterKit

## There is a demo in `demo` branch

### iOS StarterKit Introduction

This `iOS StarterKit` based on：

* IDE：Xcode8
* Language：Swift3
* Build tool：fastlane
* Dependency management：Carthage
* Code style check：SwiftLint
* Unit test framework: Quick + Nimble
* CI:
    - Jenkins
    - TBD: GoCD
    - TBD：BuildKit
* Beta testing platform:
    - HockeyAPP
    - TBD：蒲公英


#### Setup Development Environment (admin & developers)

* Install Xcode 8
* Install rbenv
* Install Carthage

```bash
brew install carthage
```

* Install Fastlane

```bash
gem install fastlane --verbose
```

* Install SwiftLint

```bash
brew install swiftlint
```

#### Admin Setup (admin or codebase manage, who is managing the Apple account, development/distribution certificates.)

##### Step-1: Apply an Apple ID

   1. Apply account for apple developer program

#### Step-2: Setup Codebase

   1. Create a new project from xcode manually
   2. Run `bundle exec fastlane init` 
   3. Copy the `Fastfile` from this `StartKit` project and replace the project specific stuff with your own one( scheme/app_identifier/git_url/api_token/ipa).
   4. Modify the `Appfile` in `./fastlane/Appfile` with your own values (app_identifier, apple_id, team_id)

#### Step-3: Config Apple Development Portal

   1. Create an `App Id` for your project
   2. Add all the testing devices' UUID in `devices`

#### Step-4: Setup certificates and provisioning profiles with `match`(a fastlane action)

```bash
Reference: `Usage` - `Setup` at `https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/match`
```

   1. Create a **private** repo (name it something like certificates)
   2. Write all the testing device’s UUID in the `./devices.txt` file of your projects
   3. Run `match init` with the private repo URL
   4. Modify the generated `Matchfile` in `./fastlane/Matchfile` with your own values (app_identifier, username, URL)
   5. Run `match development`, `match adhoc` or `match app_store` to install certificates and profiles(This will upload them to the private repo as well)
   6. Run `fastlane add_devices` every time new device is added into the file

#### Step-5: Setup Beta Testing platform: `HockeyAPP`

   1. Register a HockeyApp account
   2. Create an app manually in HockeyApp (with your project bundle identifier)
   3. Create an `API Token` for your project from `account settings` -> `API Tokens` in HockeyApp
   4. Modify `fastlane deploy_beta` lane in your `Fastfile` with the `api_token`

#### Step-6: Setup CI: `Jenkins` (on CI server)

1. Install Jenkins

```bash
brew install jenkins
```

2. Start Jenkins

```bash
jenkins
```

`http://localhost:8080`

3. Install required Jenkins plugins: `Pipeline` and `Git Plugin`, Install from jenkins console: `Manage Jenkins` -> `Manage Plugins`

4. Generate Credential

	Generate from jenkins console: `Credentials` -> `Global credentials` -> `Add Credentials`

5. Create new project

	Create from jenkins console: `New Item` -> Choose `pipeline style`

6. Configure project

	Configure from jenkins console: `Build Triggers` -> Choose Pipeline definition `Pipleline script from SCM` -> Fill the form with the created credential.


### Init Project (developer)

* Clone your own Repo generated by the codebase manager
* Setup the development environment as above and run `bundle exec fastlane carthage_update`
* Start coding

### Working flow (developer)

* Run `bundle exec fastlane checkin` locally everytime before `git push`
* CI will trigger `bundle exec fastlane beta` after every `git push` and deploy the successful build package to HockeyApp
* Run `bundle exec fastlane add_devices` every time new device is added into the file (codebase manager)
